# PoE2-LootFilter
My personal PoE2 loot filter, provided as is.

## Setup
1. Copy the sound files and the loot filter file itself to your PoE2 settings directory (or adjust `TARGET_PATH` in `setup.sh` and then execute it to have it do it for you, this symlinks the filter in place so you won't have to copy after pulling any updates)
2. Enjoy
